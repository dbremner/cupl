			THE ORIGINAL CORC DOCUMENTATION

We include here a transcription of appendix F of our reference document,
"An Instruction Manual For CORC", R.W. Conway, W.L. Maxwell, R.J. Walker.

There are a few typographical changes to fit it into the ASCII character set.
The differences:

   * ^[-+]nnn is used to render exponent superscripts.

   * The square root radical sign surrounding b is rendered as b^-2

   * |a| is used to render the absolute-value operation.

   * `x' between digits is used to render the multiplication sign.

   * lines of dashes below headings indicate underscores.

   * page breaks in the original are represented by form feeds here.

Error corrections:

   * Under `Sequence Control Statements', the IF keyword in the three
     if-statement templates was erroneously typed as `If'.

   * Under `Iteration Control Statements', the first AND keyword in the
     compound-AND example was incorrectly lowercased.  In item 1 of the BEGIN
     explanation, the word `statement' was incorrectly uppercased.

Notes:

   * Tags [See *1], [See *2], etc, are not part of the original; they reference
     footnotes following the transcript.

   * Tags such as [See 5-8] are not part of the original, they reference other
     quotes from the text given below by page number.

Otherwise, the appendix F transcription is exact, even down to hyphen breaks
and spacing (allowing for the fact that the original typewriter spacing was
somewhat irregular...).

The combination of Appendix F and the notes includes essentially all the
manual's documentation of the CORC language itself.  Most of the text is
tutorials and exercises.

This implementation preserves the CORC-62 distinction between LOG and LN, 
contrary to the transcript below which describes CORC-63 (which identifies
both with the natural-log function).  CORC-62 also lacked the INT function,
allowed only non-compound logical expressions in REPEAT...UNTIL, and allowed
an alternate spelling `TIME' of `TIMES'.

The following .corc files, included with this distribution, are also
transcribed from the manual.  We include every complete program
example.  The following list maps programs to original page numbers:

simplecorc.corc         -- 4-6
gasbill.corc            -- 4-9
hearts.corc             -- 4-10
sumsquares.corc		-- 5-4
powercorc.corc		-- 5-6
factorial.corc		-- 5-6
quadcorc.corc		-- 5-9
title.corc		-- 7-3	(note: this one uses continuations)

We have supplied leading comments and test data for these programs;
they are otherwise unaltered.

                       Summary of the CORC Language

     Acceptable Characters
     ---------------------
          Letters: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
          Digits:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
          Special Characters:  + - / ( ) * $ , . =


     Numbers
     -------
          Normal decimal usage -- + sign may be omitted; decimal point
                    may be omitted from an integer.
          Only 11 significant figures will be considered (8 on Burroughs
                    220)
          Output: 8 significant figures.
          Acceptable range: Absolute values from 10^-308 to 10^+308
                    (10^-49 to 10^+50 on Burroughs 220), and 0.
          Scientific notation: 1.2345 x 10^6 may be written 1.2345*10$(6).

     Variables and Labels
     -------------------- 
          a. 1 to 8 letters or digits; no blanks or special characters.
          b. First character must be a letter.
          c. Must not be one of the following "reserved" words:

                    ABS     DECREASE   GO         LET   NOTE      STOP
                    AND     ELSE       GTR        LN    OR        THEN
                    ATAN    END        IF         LOG   RAND      TIMES

                    COS     FOR        INT        MIN   SIN       UNTIL
                    DEC     GEQ        LEQ        NEQ   SQRT      WRITE

          d. Statement labels must be unique -- particular label appears only
                    once in label field.
                    Block label used for only one set of BEGIN-END statements.
          e. Variables must be listed in Dictionary. If no initial value
             is given zero is assumed.  [See *1]

             any expression (including subscripted variables) whose
             value at execution is a positive integer not greater than
             the maximum declared for this variable in Dictionary. [See D-2]
             In Dictionary and Input Data subscripts given as integers in
                    subscript field; parentheses are not used.  [See *1]

                              in column 42.  Do not break in middle of
                              variable, label, or number.

     Sequence Control Statements
     ---------------------------
          GO TO a             Statement with label a to be executed next.
          GO TO b             Used only inside block b; causes skip to
                              END of block b.

          IF e r f            Go to statement a if condition e r f is
             THEN GO TO a     satisfied; otherwise go to statement c.
             THEN GO TO c

          IF e r f            Go to statement a if all of the conditions
             AND g s h        listed are satisfied; otherwise go to
             ...              statement c.

             THEN GO TO a          AND and OR phrases cannot be mixed in
             THEN GO TO c          the same IF statement.

          STOP                Last statement in execution of program; not
                              necessarily written last on Program State-
                              ment sheet.

     Iteration Control Statements
     ----------------------------
          b BEGIN  Define limits of a block; b in label field, BEGIN-END.
          b END    statement field.
               1. Block may be entered (executed) only by REPEAT statement.
               2. Block may be located anywhere in program.
               3. Blocks may be nested, but not overlapped.
               4. Block b may contain any type of CORC statement, in-
                  cluding REPEAT, but not REPEAT b, ... , a REPEAT
                  Statement referring to itself.
          REPEAT b e TIMES     Value of e a non-negative integer.
          REPEAT b UNTIL e r f Continue repetition of block b until

                               of block b until all conditions listed
                               are satisfied.  (Not available on Burroughs 
                               220)
          REPEAT b UNTIL e r f OR g s h OR ... Continue repetition of
                               block b until any one of the conditions
                               listed is satisfied.  (Not available on
                               Burroughs 220)

                               block b once for each expression on list,
                               with value of expression assigned to
                               variable v.  Three expressions on list
                               enclosed in parentheses mean from h to k
                               in steps of k. [See 5-8]

     Communication Statements
     ------------------------
          READ v, w, x, ...    Read an Input Data card for each variable
                               on list; variables on cards read must
                               agree with variables on list.

          WRITE v, w, x, ...   Print variable and current value, three
                               to a line.  Each WRITE statement starts a
                               new line.

          TITLE message        Print "message" in computational results
                               when this statement is encountered in
                               execution of program.

          NOTE message         "Message" will appear in copy of program
                               only, not in execution.  Used for program
                               notes only.

---------------------------------- CUT HERE ----------------------------------

[*1] This implementation of CORC does not support or allow a
Dictionary section.  Instead, variable initializations must be done via
CUPL-style DATA and ALLOCATE statements.

[*2] Ignore this section.  Program statements are free-format, with
continuations not supported (though the example program
test/title.corc shows the syntax, it will break cupl).  Data for read
statements is accepted in CUPL format following the keyword *DATA.

For completeness, however, the Dictionary feature is documented here.

From 2-10:

Dictionary of Variables
-----------------------
     In addition to a set of statements CORC requires a pro-
gram to contain another part known as the Dictionary.  The Diction-
ary of a program is merely a list of all the variables used in
the program. along with, if desired, the initial assigned values of
the variables.  If no initial value is specified the computer
assigns the initial value zero.

From 2-11:

     In the above example the Dictionary might look like this:

     A     1
     B    -1
     C    -6
     ROOT
     X1
     X2

[The `above example' is the simplecorc.corc program.  The CORC Dictionary
is equivalent to a CUPL DATA section, but also allowed the programmer to
dimension array variables.  The example form on 2-12 makes it clear that
the Dictionary was distinguished from the program proper by being in a
different lower range of card line numbers.] 

From 5-8:

Three expressions on a list, enclosed in parentheses, are in-
terpreted in the following way:
     1. The first expression gives the initial value for the vari-
        able.
     2. The second expression gives the difference between con-
        secutive values.
     3. The third expression indicates where to stop -- the final
        value for the variable is less than or equal to the value
        of the third expression.

[... examples omitted ...]

    More than one such "triple" may be used on a list, and
"triples" may be intermixed with separate expressions;

From 6-5:

   A particular variable either has no subscripts, one sub-
script, or two subscripts and this use must be consistent through-
out a program.  A variable cannot appear as X(I) in one statement
and X(I, J) or just X in another statement of the same program.
The nature of a variable (whether it is to be subscripted or not)
must be indicated when the variable is listed in the CORC Diction-
ary.  This is done by giving the maximum value of any subscripts
that will be used in columns 21-25 of the Dictionary form.  If no
subscripts will be used these columns will be left blank in the
line for that variable.  If one subscript is to be used, the maxi-
mum value that that subscript will take on anywhere in the pro-
gram must be given in columns 21-23; columns 24-25 are left blank.
(Note that this is the maximum value of the subscript, and not
the maximum value of the variable.)  If two subscripts are to be
used the maximum value of the first is given in columns 21-23
and the maximum value of the second in columns 24-25.  For ex-
ample, if the Dicitonary [sic] looks like the following:

          SCALAR
          VECTOR    45
          MATRIX   100     2
          ARRAY      3    32

then SCALAR is a simple variable that will not have any sub-
scripts anywhere in the program.  VECTOR will have one subscript
everwhere it appears in the program [...] MATRIX [...] will 
appear each time with two subscripts [...] ARRAY will also
always have two subscripts; [...]

From D-2:

Automatic Integer Round-off
---------------------------
a. The value of a subscript is rounded off to the nearest
   integer.
b. If the round-off involves a change of greater than
   10^-9 (approximately;   the number is subject to some
   variation) an error message is given.

From D-3:

Automatic Relative Round-off for x r y
--------------------------------------
a. If both x and y are zero the condition is applied as it stands.
b. If either x or y is not zero:
   (i) Both x and y are multiplied by MAX(|x|, |y|);
   (ii) The results are rounded off to the nearest 
        integer if this involves a change of less
        than 10^-9 (10^-7 for the Burroughs 220), but
        not otherwise;
   (iii) The specified condition is interpreted for
        the resulting numbers.
