			CUPL Implementation Notes

The CUPL implementation is built around YACC and LEX.  The rest is
ANSI and POSIX-conformant C.

The YACC grammar just builds a parse tree, which is passed to
interpret() for interpretation.  This method requires that all
programs are always small enough that the entire tree can be held
in memory, but it has the advantage that front and back end are very
well separated.  It is a winning strategy on virtual-memory systems.

One hack that greatly simplifies the grammar productions is that the
lexer actually returns parse tree nodes, even for atoms like
identifiers, strings, and numbers.  In fact, the lexical analyzer even
does label and variable name resolution with the same simple piece of
code; each IDENTIFIER token is looked up in the identifier list when
it's recognized, so the parse tree early becomes a DAG.  (The -v1 option
causes the compiler to dump its parse tree for inspection.)

Most of the smarts are in interpret() and its sub-functions.  Because
array variables can be re-allocated, the internals have to use a
dynamic vector/array type with its own indexing machinery.  The code
to manipulate this type lives in monitor.c.

Note that much of this machinery is quite generic and could be re-used
for other languages with little change.

The implementation trades away some possible efficiencies for
simplicity.  Most importantly, each value has an attached malloc
object to hold its elements, even when there is only one such element
(as for scalars) which could reasonably be represented by a static
field.

There are some comments in the code which discuss the possibility of
a back end that would emit C.   This would be easy to do if there were
any serious corpus of CUPL code demanding to be translated.  The
compiler back end would emit code shaped like the parse tree, which
would then link monitor.c as runtime support.
